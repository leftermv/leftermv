### Hi there üêß

You found this profile, so I guess you're curious about me.

Nothing special here. 

I'm just passionate about the digital world and started my cybersecurity journey on my own while I was studying Computer Science. As for now, I'm working in the cybersecurity field while continually expanding my knowledge by doing CTFs. 

When I'm not online, you might catch me reading, picking up a new skill or spinning some vinyl records.

I love the mix of old-school vibes and cutting-edge tech :D

The purpose of this github profile is to mostly aid me through my continuous learning experience, backing up notes, scripts, writeups and so on.
I've decided to leave the writeups to the CTFs I'm doing public ‚Äî‚Äî maybe you'll need help with a CTF at some point in your life, eh?

Github, however, is not my highest priority. I will manually update repositories from time to time or running some automatizations in background (mostly for private stuff).

As I told you, nothing special here :) Take care, stranger!
