### Hi üêß <img align="right" img src="https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=leftermv.leftermv&"  />

I'm a Computer Science student. In my spare time, I usually enjoy reading non fiction.  

I am engaged in independent cybersecurity learning by doing CTFs or reading books. 

Currently working part-time at a great IT company :)

I'm trying to learn as much as possible about cybersecurity so I (try to) keep a repository with CTF writeups. Sometime, here will be a repository containing scripts I'll write in order to help me solve certain CTFs.  

However, my time is very limited, and I don't expect my activity on Github to be one of my highest priorities.
