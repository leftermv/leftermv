### Hi üêß

I'm a Computer Science student. In my spare time, I usually enjoy reading non fiction.  

I am engaged in independent cybersecurity learning by doing CTFs or reading books. 

Currently working part-time at a great IT company :)

I'm trying to learn as much as possible about cybersecurity so I (try to) keep a repository with CTF writeups.

However, my time is very limited, and I don't expect my activity on Github to be one of my highest priorities.
