### Hi there üêß

You found this profile, so I guess you're curious about me.

Nothing special here. 

I'm just passionate about the digital world and started my cybersecurity journey on my own while I was studying Computer Science. As for now, I'm working in the cybersecurity field while continually expanding my knowledge by doing CTFs. 

When I'm not online, you might catch me reading, picking up a new skill or spinning some vinyl records.

I love the mix of old-school vibes and cutting-edge tech :D 

I document my cybersecurity learning journey at leftermv.com
